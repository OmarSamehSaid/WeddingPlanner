# WeddingPlanner
You are planning the seating arrangement for a wedding given a list of guests,
V Suppose you are also given a lookup table T where T[u] for u âˆˆ V is a list of guests that u knows.
If u knows v, then v knows u.
You are required to arrange the seating such that any guest at a table knows every other guest sitting at the same table either directly or through some other guests sitting at the same table.
For example, if x knows y, and y knows z, then x, y, z can sit at the same table. Describe an efficient algorithm that, given V and T, returns the minimum number of tables needed to achieve this requirement.
